            <p>
                Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent,
                characterized by its aromatic rice layered with marinated meat (often chicken, mutton, beef, or seafood)
                along with a blend of spices. It's considered a culinary masterpiece and is immensely popular across various 
                regions in India and neighboring countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Biryani is typically prepared in a sealed pot or a vessel, allowing the steam to circulate within, 
                ensuring the rice and meat cook together while absorbing the rich aromas and flavors. The slow cooking process helps amalgamate all the ingredients,
                resulting in a dish that's both aromatic and incredibly delicious.

                        <li>Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, lemon juice, and salt. Marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil/ghee in a large pan or pot. Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions for later use.</li>
                        <li>Add chopped tomatoes, green chilies, mint leaves, coriander leaves, red chili powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and oil starts to separate.</li>
                        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the masala and cook for about 10-15 minutes on medium heat until the chicken is almost cooked. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Cook the rice: In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add soaked Basmati rice, whole spices, and salt. Cook until the rice is 70-80% done. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Layering the biryani: Take a heavy-bottomed pan or a deep pot. Spread a layer of cooked chicken at the bottom. Add a layer of partially cooked rice over the chicken. Sprinkle saffron milk, fried onions, chopped mint leaves, and coriander leaves. Repeat the layers until all chicken and rice are used, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
                        <li>Drizzle some ghee or oil over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with a lid, sealing the edges with dough or a kitchen towel to trap steam.</li>
                        <li>Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together and the rice to finish cooking through.</li>
                        <li>Once done, gently mix the layers before serving. Serve hot Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani with raita or salad.</li>
