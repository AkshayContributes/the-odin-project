                Mutton curry is a savory and aromatic dish made with tender pieces of mutton (goat meat) cooked in a flavorful blend
                of spices and herbs. It is a popular dish in various cuisines around the world, especially in South Asian, Middle Eastern,
                and Southeast Asian regions.

                The preparation of mutton curry involves marinating the meat in a mix of spices like turmeric, 
                red chili powder, coriander, cumin, and garam masala, along with other ingredients like ginger, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. 
                The marinated mutton is then cooked slowly in oil or ghee until it becomes tender, allowing the flavors to infuse into the meat.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or pressure cooker. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté for a few minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
                        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil begins to separate.</li>
                        <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well and cook the spices for a couple of minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add the mutton pieces to the pot. Mix them well with the spices and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                        <li>Pour in enough water to cover the mutton pieces. Cover the pot or pressure cooker and cook until the mutton is tender. If using a pot, it might take around 60-90 minutes, while a pressure cooker might take around 20-25 minutes after reaching full pressure.</li>
                        <li>Once the mutton is cooked and tender, check for seasoning and adjust salt or spices if needed. Sprinkle garam masala powder and mix gently.</li>
                        <li>Let the curry simmer for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to blend. If the gravy is too thin, you can cook it uncovered for a while to thicken it or add a slurry of cornstarch (mixed with water) to thicken.</li>
                        <li>Garnish the mutton curry with chopped coriander leaves.</li>
                        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice, naan, roti, or any bread of your choice.</li>
