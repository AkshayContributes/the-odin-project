                            <li>Pasta: The dish starts by boiling spaghetti pasta in salted water until it reaches al dente, meaning it's cooked to be firm to the bite. It's then drained, reserving some of the pasta water.</li>
                            <li>Garlic and Olive Oil: In a separate pan, thinly sliced or minced garlic cloves are gently saut√©ed in a generous amount of extra-virgin olive oil over low to medium heat. The garlic is cooked until it becomes fragrant and starts to turn golden, being careful not to burn it. Some recipes may include red pepper flakes for a hint of heat and additional flavor.</li>
                            <li>Combining Pasta and Garlic Oil: The cooked spaghetti is added to the pan with the garlic-infused olive oil. Tossing the pasta in the oil ensures that each strand is coated with the flavorful mixture. Some recipes might use a splash of reserved pasta water to help emulsify the oil and create a silky texture.</li>
                            <li>Seasoning and Garnish: Chopped fresh parsley is sprinkled over the pasta to add a vibrant touch of color and fresh herbal flavor. Grated Parmesan cheese may also be added for extra richness and depth, though it's optional.</li>
